LONG TERM

It'd be great to have a simple way to update question banks outside of Canvas.

- Questions aren't always going to be code questions. Need templates for:
    - Fill in the blank
    - Multiple choice
- Use different template strings for these? E.g.:
    - {{text}} = text
    - {{select}} = multiple choice
- Firestore integration
