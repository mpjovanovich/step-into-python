TODO:

- Migrate everything on here to GitHub Issues; we've outgrown a single txt file for planning.
  - Look at developer tasks format GH Issues template from SDEV255
  - Consider using actual GH issues template in the repo

- Finish refactor (see notes below)

- Admin console: currently using console scripts to create users and check how many exercises each student has run; need UI so other instructors can check on their course sections

- Decouple exercises from application; exercises are JSON template stored in the database, but they're currently tracked with the application in source control. If I remove these I can open source the application.
- create repo for SIP exercises
  - git filter-repo to remove exercises from SIP
- Make a feedback button or link to create GitHub Issue for feedback.
- Create a README now that this will be open source. Should include template format.
- Public demo for some exercises along with video on landing page.

REFACTOR

- TEST:
  - domain/templateParser
  - domain/answerChecker
  - Refactor ProgramOutput.tsx to use these modules
  - services/exerciseService.ts
  - services/userService.ts
  - refactor App.tsx to use these modules
  - refactor UI; general cleanup for better component modularity

NEXT STEPS:

- Refactor for testing
- Maybe port to Svelte; need to see how it'll play with FireBase
- Admin console
  - Ensure that database structure supports tracking sections by section number
  - Instructors should have view/edit permission only for their assigned section; not for all sections
  - .. TODO ..
- Backup database
  - https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/export-import
- Better feedback on correct/incorrect answers. Add a border with color to the input field.
- Visual feedback on current line?

... remove this along with file in source control ...
