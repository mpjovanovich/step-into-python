NEXT STEPS:

- Description and instruction for each step
- Quiz questions from database. App page should be ported to "Exercise" page
- Logins
- Front page to show completed exercises
- Make it look nice


LONG TERM

- Wizard style navigation for problem sets consisting of multiple exercises

- Questions aren't always going to be code questions. Need templates for:
    - Fill in the blank
    - Multiple choice
- Use different template strings for these? E.g.:
    - {{text}} = text
    - {{select}} = multiple choice

EXAMPLE EXERCISE:

1?print("BEGIN PROGRAM")
2?print("Hello, earth!")
3?print("Hello, moon!")
4?print("Hello, {{sun}}!")
5?print("END PROGRAM")
