NEXT STEPS:

- Create Logins
  - Ivy Tech seems to be blocking password reset emails.
  - Going to have to assign a password to each user manually.
- Backup database
  - https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/export-import
- Better feedback on correct/incorrect answers. Add a border with color to the input field.
- Add section number to student database records.


LONG TERM

- Wizard style navigation for problem sets consisting of multiple exercises

- Questions aren't always going to be code questions. Need templates for:
    - Fill in the blank
    - Multiple choice
- Use different template strings for these? E.g.:
    - {{text}} = text
    - {{select}} = multiple choice

EXAMPLE EXERCISE:

1?print("BEGIN PROGRAM")
2?print("Hello, earth!")
3?print("Hello, moon!")
4?print("Hello, {{sun}}!")
5?print("END PROGRAM")

DATABASE STRUCTURE:

// Course Collection
// Path: courses/{courseId}
{
  id: string,            // Auto-generated or custom course identifier
  name: string,          // Course name
  description: string,   // Optional course description
  
  // Path: courses/{courseId}/questions/{questionId}
  questions: {
    id: string,          // Unique question identifier
    content: string,     // Question text
    ...
  }
}

// Student Collection
// Path: students/{studentId}
{
  id: string,            // Student unique identifier
  email: string,         // Student's email (for login)
  name: string,          // Student's name
  enrolledCourses: string[], // Array of course IDs student is enrolled in
  
  // Path: students/{studentId}/courseProgress/{courseId}
  courseProgress: {
    courseId: string,    // Reference to the course
    completedQuestions: { // Will not exist if the question is not completed
      questionId: string,  // ID of completed question
      completedAt: timestamp  // Timestamp of completion
    }[]
  }
