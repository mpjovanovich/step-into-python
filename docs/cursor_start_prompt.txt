I need to build a Python educational content generation pipeline. I have example JSON files in /examples that show the exact format needed.... + docs folder ...

The pipeline has 4 stages:
1. Generate a program summary for a topic
2. Create Python code from the summary  
3. Break into educational steps
4. Encode as JSON matching the examples

Key requirements:
- @@placeholders@@ become HTML inputs for students
- Visibility markers (3?, 2:4?) control when lines appear
- Each JSON teaches exactly one concept
- Break steps at natural teaching moments

Please start by examining the /examples folder and creating the project structure.
