    "1": "So far we've been comparing values explicitly, like 'if name != \"\"'. Python actually gives us a shorter way to write these checks using a concept called truthiness (technically boolean coercion). We'll explore that in this lesson.",
    "2": "Here we check if 'name' has a value using an explicit comparison to \"\". Python gives us a more concise way to write this — any non-empty string is considered truthy, meaning it behaves like True in a boolean context. So 'if name != \"\"' can be written simply as 'if name'.",
    "3": "Your turn. Practice writing a truthy check with a hardcoded non-empty string.",
    "4": "Now the flip side. An empty string \"\" is considered falsy — it behaves like False. So instead of 'if name == \"\"' we can use the 'not' keyword to negate the truthy value: 'if not name'.",
    "5": "Your turn. Practice writing a negated truthy check with a hardcoded empty string.",
    "6": "Now let's apply this in a realistic context. We'll get a name from the user and use a guard clause — a check that catches invalid input early and handles it before the rest of the program runs.",
    "7": "Supply the guard clause condition.",
    "8": "Let's review:\n1) Any non-empty string is truthy — it behaves like True.\n2) An empty string is falsy — it behaves like False.\n3) We can use this to write cleaner conditions without explicit comparisons to \"\".\n4) A guard clause uses a negated truthy check to catch invalid input early."

    "3": "Write an if statement that prints 'Hello, Alice!' if name is truthy. Use the variable name in the condition, not an explicit comparison.",
    "5": "Write an if statement that prints 'No name entered.' if name is falsy. Use the 'not' keyword in the condition.",
    "7": "Write the guard clause condition to check if name is empty using a truthy check."
