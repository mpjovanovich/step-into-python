    "1": "So far we've been comparing values explicitly for all data types. \nIn this example we want to make sure that the user did not enter an empty string for their name prior to printing a greeting. Note the comparison to \"\" (empty string). \nMany programming languages use a concept called truthiness (technically boolean coercion) to offer a more concise way to write these checks. That's what we'll explore in this lesson.",
    "2": "In this snippet we've modified the previous example to use a truthy check by ommitting the comparison to \"\".\nAny non-empty string is considered truthy, meaning it behaves like True in a boolean context. So 'if name != \"\"' can be written simply as 'if name'.\nThis code works exactly the same as the previous example. Try running it yourself with a non-empty string and an empty string.",
    "3": "We can use the same technique to check for empty string input. This code snippet shows an explicit way to check input and display a warning message if the input is empty.",
    "4": "Now let's use a truthiness check. An empty string \"\" is considered falsy — it behaves like False. We can use the 'not' keyword to check is the input is empty.\nRecall that a double negative is a positive, so the condition will evaluate to True if the input is empty.\nTry running it. An empty input should give you the warning.",
    "5": "Time to give it a try. Rewrite the comparison statements above using a truthiness checks. You can go back to previous steps if you need to review.",
    "6": "Let's review:\n1) Any non-empty string is truthy — it behaves like True.\n2) An empty string is falsy — it behaves like False.\n3) We can use this to write cleaner conditions without explicit comparisons to \"\"."
