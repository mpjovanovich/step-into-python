    "1": "Integers are whole numbers without decimal points.\nThey can represent quantities like age, year, or temperature.\nIntegers are written as numbers without quotes: 25, 2024, -5",
    "2": "Integers are best used for counting discrete items - things you can count individually.\nFor example: the number of students in a class, books on a shelf, or items in inventory.\nIf you're counting whole units, use an integer.",
    "3": "We can perform arithmetic operations with integers.\nLet's add two integers together to get a total.",
    "4": "When we print the result, we'll see the sum of our two integer values.",
    "5": "Subtraction works the same way with integers.\nLet's calculate how many items remain after removing some.",
    "6": "Integers can be positive, negative, or zero.\nNegative integers are useful for representing things like penalties, debts, or temperatures below zero.\nTo create a negative integer, simply put a minus sign in front of the number.",
    "7": "When we add a positive and negative integer, the result accounts for both values.\nIn this case, our final score is 90: 100 - 10 for the penalty.",
    "8": "Let's review:\n1) Integers are whole numbers (no decimal points)\n2) They can be positive, negative, or zero\n3) Use integers for counting discrete items\n4) Integers support arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction"
